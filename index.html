        This specification defines a <dfn>web manifest</dfn>, which is a JSON
        document that a user agent can use to provide enhanced bookmarking
        capabilities. Unlike regular bookmarks, this specification allows
        developers to specify a range of icons, the name of the web
        application, as well as the url to launch when a website is bookmarked
        to, for example, the homescreen of a device. It also defines a special
        "standalone" mode in which applications can be launched, which is
        intended to allow web applications to run independently of a web
        browser and more tightly integrate with native application
        environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification also defines two ways to allows a web page to be
        associated with a web manifest: through the <code>manifest</code> link
        type or through bookmark API.

        Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable.
        <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are
        likely to find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should join the aforementioned mailing lists and take part in the
        discussions.

        Web manifest
      </h2>
      <p>
        A web <a>manifest</a> is a [[!JSON]] document that consists of a
        top-level object (the web manifest <dfn>root</dfn>) and one or more
        members, some of which contain other objects.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          <code title="">name</code> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="propdef-name"><code>name</code></dfn> is a string that
          represents the name of the application as is usually displayed to the
          user (e.g., amongst a list of other applications, or as a label
          underneath an icon).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for processing the name member</dfn> is given by the
          following algorithm. The algorithm takes a web manifest as an
          argument and returns either an error or a string:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>value</var> be the result of calling the
          [[\GetOwnProperty]] internal method of <var>manifest</var> passing
          "<code>name</code>" as the argument.
          </li>
          <li>If <var>value</var> is <code>null</code> or
          <code>undefined</code>, then let <var>value</var> be an
          implementation specific string that can serve as a suitable name for
          the application. For example, if the manifest was obtained from a
          <code>link</code> element and the document has a title, then the
          document's <code>title</code> could be used. Alternatively, the user
          could be prompted to provide a custom name.

        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for processing the short name member</dfn> is given by

        Processing the web manifest
      </h2>
      <p id="ecmascript-abstractop">
        Algorithms in this specification use the conventions described in
        [[!ECMA-262]], such as the use of steps and sub-steps, and so on. The
        <a class="external" href=
        "http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-9.1.3"><dfn>ToNumber</dfn></a>,

        abstract operations and the <a class="external" href=
        "http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-8">Type(<var>x</var>)</a>
        notation referenced in this section are defined in [[!ECMA-262]].
        Processing also relies on various algorithms defined in [[!HTML]],
        [[!FETCH]], and [[!URL]].
      </p>
      <p>
        As the web manifest format is a [[!JSON]] document, this specification
        relies on the types defined in [[!JSON]] specification: namely <dfn id=
        "json-object">object</dfn>, <dfn id="json-array">array</dfn>, <dfn id=
        "json-number">number</dfn>, and <dfn id="json-string">string</dfn>.
        Strict type checking is not enforced by this specification. Instead,
        each member's definition specifies the steps required to process a
        particular member.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithms, to <dfn>ignore</dfn> means that the user agent MUST
        act as if the developer had not declared the particular member in the
        web manifest document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain error conditions can result in a web <a>manifest</a> being
        treated as an <a>invalid web manifest</a>. An <dfn>invalid web
        manifest</dfn> is a web manifest that is deemed to be non-conforming in
        such a way that it would not be possible for the user agent to continue
        processing (e.g., it can't be parsed by the JSON parser because of a
        syntax error). In such a case, the user agent MAY report the error to
        the user in a user-agent-specific manner, MAY <a href=
        "http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#navigate">navigate</a>
        to an error page to report the error, or MAY ignore the error and do
        nothing. In either case, when a step results in an <a>invalid web
        manifest</a> the user agent MUST abort whatever step or sub-step caused
        the condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>steps for processing a web manifest</dfn> are given by the
        following algorithm:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>text</var> be the result of <a href=
        "http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch">fetching</a> the web

        an <a>invalid web manifest</a>.

        <li>Let <var>manifest</var> be the result of invoking the <a href=
        "https://people.mozilla.com/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-15.12.2">parse</a>
        function of the JSON object defined in [[!ECMASCRIPT]] with
        <var>text</var> as its only argument. If parsing throws an exception,
        then treat this web manifest as an <a>invalid application manifest</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        If the protocol over which the web manifest is transferred supports the
        [[!MIME-TYPES]] specification (e.g. [[!HTTP11]]), it is RECOMMENDED
        that the web manifest be labeled with the <a>media type for a web
        manifests</a>.

        <dt>
          Security considerations:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            As the web manifest format is JSON and will commonly be encoded
            using [[!UNICODE]], the security considerations described in
            [[!JSON]] and [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]] apply. In addition,
            implementors need to impose their own implementation-specific
            limits on the values of otherwise unconstrained member types, e.g.
            to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running out
            of memory, or to work around platform-specific limitations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web manifest document allows developeres, through the
            permissions and <code>permissions</code> members, to request
            permission to enable security sensitive APIs. As these APIs are
            outside the scope of this specification, significant caution needs
            to be taken when granting an application the capability to use a
            feature. The relevant APIs define their own security considerations
            (see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/sysapps/#roadmap">System
            Applications Working Group's APIs</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS
            files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
            environment. As such, implementors need to be aware of the security
            implications for the types they support. Specifically, implementors
            need to consider the security implications outlined in the
            [[!CSS-MIME]] specification, the [[!ECMAScript-MIME]]
            specification, and the [[!HTML]] specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            As web applications can contain content that is able to
            simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
            implementors need to consider the privacy implications resulting
            from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation and
            in-depth defensive measures are an implementation responsibility
            and not prescribed by this specification. However, in designing
            these measures, implementors are advised to enable user awareness
            of information sharing, and to provide easy access to interfaces
            that enable revocation of permissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this specification allows for the declaration of IRIs within
            certain members of the web manifest, implementors need to consider
            the security considerations discussed in the [IRI] specification.
            Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
            "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
            <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
            found in the web manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the
            security advice given in [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]].
